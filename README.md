# Evoastra_Data_Science_Major_Project
In order to identify the factors influencing loan default in this project, loan data will be examined using exploratory data analysis, or EDA. The objective is to detect trends, outliers, missing data, and data imbalance using univariate and bivariate analysis. You can identify clients experiencing payment difficulties from those who are not by looking for strong connections in the data. Next, using visual aids, you will present your findings and make recommendations for better lending decisions.
